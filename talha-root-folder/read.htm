Not even prison can hold Dr. Wily from doing evil deeds!

Dr. Wily knew that one day his plans would fail him. But as the world cheered at his capture, the nefarious scientist stowed four robots in his lab, set to activate after six months of no communication from their master. Now the robots have started a rampage in the city, which serves as the perfect distraction for Dr. Wily to make his getaway.

But Mega Man and his trusty sidekick, Rush, are hot on his trail...and so are Bass and Treble? Who are these mysterious companions? Jump, power up, and blast your way through robotic enemies, and send Dr. Wily back to prison where he belongs!

         <h4>Sonic Boom Fire and Ice</h4>
                <p>Race through this epic new adventure as Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles or Sticks to stop Dr. Eggman, and an all new adversary D-Fekt. Harness the power of fire and ice to blaze through obstacles, puzzles, and freeze enemies in their tracks. Utilize Sonic’s speed, Tails' flight, Knuckles' strength, Sticks' Boomerang and Amy’s hammer to explore, fight and race through an undiscovered land. Compete with your friends in 2 player bot racing and unlock 6 new tracks as you collect artifacts throughout the world. Battle bosses so huge they take up both screens. Play mini games filled with challenging puzzles and time trials including a new iteration of the popular Sea Fox.

Dr. Eggman has discovered the supercharged element ragnium on the mythical Island of Ragna Rock. He mines it as a fuel source, piping off the messy by-products of the operation to adjacent islands, creating fire and ice gameplay. Using this fuel to power his ultra-fast bot racers is his latest plan to discredit his eternal rival Sonic, but backed by ragnium, fire and ice, a robot army, and D-Fekt, an unflinchingly powerful henchman, this time Dr. Eggman just may succeed. Sonic and friends must re-claim each island by destroying enemies, vanquishing the Island Defender, winning rival races, and reversing the flow of the elemental tubes. It all culminates with an epic battle on the Island of Ragna Rock where Sonic may just have to save Dr. Eggman from his own creation.</p>
